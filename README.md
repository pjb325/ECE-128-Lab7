# ECE-128-Lab7

In this lab, we will be creating Verilog representations and testbenches for different computer elements. 
The elements we will be testing are an SR-Lacth and Flip-Flop, an asynchronus and synchronus D Flip-Flop, a
T Flip-FLop and it's equivalent counter, and a clock divider. All the modules and test modules are included.
